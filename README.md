# etch-a-sketch

v2 changelog:
1. updated 'rainbow' paint 
2. added 'darken' and 'eraser' paints
3. removed border on painted cells
4. split 'createGrid' function
5. added 'mousedown' listener for cells for better responsiveness

Sketchpad website created in JavaScript for the Odin Project curriculum. Struggled while trying to figure out how to create the grid, but overall I think it turned out pretty decent, and I learned a lot about DOM manipulation in particular.
