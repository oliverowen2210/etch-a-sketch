# etch-a-sketch

Sketchpad website created in JavaScript for the Odin Project curriculum. Struggled while trying to figure out how to create the grid, but overall I think it turned out pretty decent, and I learned a lot about DOM manipulation in particular.

Later I'll probably improve the rainbow paint and add the optional 'darken' paint, add a font and make current selection clearer.
